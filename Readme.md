To run this project
===================

1Ô∏è‚É£ Make sure you have Rust installed

If you haven‚Äôt installed Rust yet:

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh


Then reload your shell and check:

rustc --version
cargo --version

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create or check .env

Since you‚Äôre using dotenvy, you‚Äôll likely have something like:

DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@localhost/db_name


Make sure .env is in your project root.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the project

From your project root (where Cargo.toml is):

cargo build

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the project

Simply:

cargo run


Rocket will start, and you‚Äôll see output like:

üöÄ Rocket has launched from http://127.0.0.1:8000


By default:

Rocket reads Rocket.toml (optional) for configuration.

Without it, dev mode runs at localhost:8000.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Optional: Run in release mode

For better performance:

cargo run --release

6Ô∏è‚É£ Hot reloading (optional)

Rust doesn‚Äôt have native hot reloading, but you can use cargo-watch:

cargo install cargo-watch
cargo watch -x run


That will restart Rocket every time you change code.

‚úÖ So in your case:

cd /path/to/rusty
cargo run


‚Ä¶will start your Rocket server.
